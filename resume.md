## Account Management , Billing & Support

**AWS Organizations**\
It's a global service\
Multiple Organization = One Bill and Discount because use more resources.

Multi Account Strategies
- Create account per departament or per environment (dev, test, prod)

Service Control Policies
- Applied at the OU or Account
- SCP is applied to all User and roles
- Use to restrict access to certain services
- If one in the hierarchy deny nothing under can allow.

**AWS Control Tower**
- Set up and govern a secure and compliant
- Detect policy violations
- Monitor compliance
- Run on top of AWS Organizations

**Princing Models in AWS
- Pay as you go
- Save when you reserve
- Pay less by using more 
- Pay less as AWS grows

**Free services&&
- IAM, VPNC, Billing, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation , Auto Scaling Groups

**Compute Pricing - EC2**
- On-demand: Minimum 60s, pay per second
- Reserved Instances: Up to 75% discord , 1 - 3 years commitment
- - Payment types: All upfront, partial upfront, no upfront
- Spot Instances: Upp to 90% discount compared to on demand
- Dedicated Host
- Savings Plans

**Lambda & ECS Pricing**
- Lambda: Pay per call, pay per duration
- ECS: EC2 Lauch Type Model -> No additional fees, you pay for AWS resources.
- Fargate: Pay for CPU and Memory allocated to your apps on containers

**S3 Pricing **
